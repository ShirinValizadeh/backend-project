# backend-project
Front-end developers focus on working with tools, technologies, and programming languages that run inside web browsers.
Back-end developers focus on…. everything else.

#To start, a web browser reaches out to the Internet and performs what’s known as an HTTP GET request to the URL that is visited.
#Magic happens through the pipes in the Internet
#Eventually, it will reach a server (a computer) that you as a web developer have control of.

# Databases

#On your computer, you probably store most of the data in files in your file system. Your servers will have files that you can access too, but generally, you’ll want to store data in databases.

#Databases allow you to add, remove, change, and access things, like user-generated data, more easily. Nearly all web applications use databases, and there are two major different types of databases: SQL(Most web applications use SQL databases. It’s common to build web applications that allow you to create rows, read them, update them and destroy them) and NoSQL.
